# Mines_Sweeper
This is a simple game of Mines Sweeper made using javafx
<br />The gameplay is the same as the original game
<br />To start playing the game just left click a box of your choice on the grid to open it
<br />The numbers on the boxes determine how many bombs there are in a 3X3 area arount the box
<br />You can toggle a flag by pressing the right click button on the desired box
<br />A box with a flag on it cannot be opened manually
<br />There is a background music for the game that can be muted or volume adjusted as you wish
<br />A game is won by openig all the boxes that do not contain a bomb undeer them, falgs are for your own convinience
<br />When a game is won a popup will appear to notify you
<br />If you opened a bomb the game is over and you need to press "Reset" to restart the game
<br />Each new generated mine is different and completely random
